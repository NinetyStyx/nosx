This is a simple Windows HTA to clean up
[the junk files](http://www.westwind.com/reference/os-x/invisibles.html)
typically left behind on shared media by OS X.


How to Use
----------

Download the included `.hta` file on a Windows machine and double-click to
launch the script.  Click on "Browse" to select a folder to clean, or enter
its path by hand, then click "Clean" to recursively remove any OS X junk
files therein.


Bugs
----

Can't drag and drop folders onto the script's window.  I don't know of a
good way to do this with an HTA, unfortunately.

I should note that I haven't tested this at all on a machine with IE 7 or
lower; it's possible the UI will be messed up with earlier versions of IE.
